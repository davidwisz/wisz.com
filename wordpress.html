            <strong>National Trails Guide</strong><br/>
            A reference website for the U.S. National Trails system, and companion website to the book.
          </p>
          <p>
            I led this website redesign, working closely with the author to choose a theme, then modified the design to fit our brand. Theme choice was based on its out-of-the-box layout, editor options, ease of use and customization, and price. I simplified the info architecture, created the design in collaboration with stakeholders, and built the website.
          </p>
          <p>Implementation notes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>New WordPress install + imported database from old website.</li>
            <li>Deep dive into Avada theme's Fusion Builder options.</li>
            <li>Customized all the CSS and tweaked JS for random UI behavior.</li>
            <li>Custom footer and side widgets.</li>
            <li>Lots of content creation, image editing, and editing HTML.</li>
            <li>Integrated Salesforce leadgen form and later swapped it out for a MailChimp contact form.</li>
          </ul>

            <strong>Telmate</strong><br/>
            The corporate B2B website for a prison/jail communications provider. Our target audience is correctional facility personnel and sheriffs across the U.S. The website's goal is to promote brand trust and connotation with high tech, to drive adoption of our technology in facilities.

            This was one of about five WPEngine-hosted WordPress properties I maintained at Telmate during my 4.5 years as Web Developer on the marketing team. The most challenging aspect was juggling many different projects on tight deadlines. I had to acclimate to the pace of a marketing department and use broad strokes, so unfortunately I didn't have bandwidth to optimize the site to its full potential. Ultimately, I was able to set up tracking, analytics, and reporting for all of our web initiatives, which enabled some data-driven decision making for the team, and also helped drive revenue.
          </p>

          <p>Some of the telmate.com initiatives I spearheaded and/or built:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website redesign - entirely customized Enfold child theme, custom plugin, Advanced Custom Fields, Cloudflare.</li>
            <li>SEM landing pages with custom page templates and A/B tests measuring conversions.</li>
            <li>GEO-IP-based GDPR and CCPA content restrictions.</li>
            <li>SEO program.</li>
            <li>Centralized terms and privacy documents for ajax use across all digital products, eventually moved to AWS for better performance.</li>
            <li>Banner ad function served from website conditionally - URL query string values processed in PHP.</li>
            <li>Home page modal popover driven by cookied behavior to guide consumers to the appropriate B2C website.</li>
            <li>Conditional audience-sensitive UI to toggle contact form destination: Salesforce or customer service queue.</li>
            <li>Multisite configuration to host a subdomained engineering blog.</li>

            This was one of about five WPEngine-hosted WordPress properties I maintained at Telmate during my 4.5 years as Web Developer on the marketing team. I inherited this website from my predecessor, and, like the telmate.com site, I didn't have bandwidth to optimize the site to its full potential.

            <strong>ConnectNetwork (GTL)</strong><br/>
            GTL acquired Telmate in 2017, and ConnectNetwork is their B2C website, similar to Telmate's GettingOut website.
